# PiazzaBot
PiazzaBot is a simple slack bot that makes discussing posts on Piazza easier.
When a post is mentioned by ID, PiazzaBot will respond with a link to that
post.

## Installation
[to do]

## Development
PiazzaBot is built using [Slack's Bolt framework](https://github.com/SlackAPI/bolt-python).


## Contributing
Still thinking about the ideal workflow, however I'd like to keep PM on
GitHub for now, and keep track of all to-do and in-progress via issues.
